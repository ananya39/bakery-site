         <h3>Baguette</h3>
         <p>Best consumed within a few hours of baking this iconic french bread is one of the most popular bread found worldwide. French bread law protects the integrity of the ingredients used to make baguettes.</p>
     </div>
     <div class="Specialties-col">
         <h3>Sourdough</h3>
         <p>Allowing time and temperature to develop the natural yeasts in the environment and raise the bread is not a new idea. The widespread use of commercial yeast nearly lost this artisan bread. </p>
     </div>
     <div class="Specialties-col">
         <h3>Rye Bread</h3>
         <p>Rye bread is high in fibre and has an extremely strong flavour when compared to other flours. A lack of gluten in rye flour can often lead to dense, heavy bread. Combining rye and white flour is a common method that is used to make great tasting bread. </p>

    <h1>Our Goal</h1>
    <p class="sectionSubTag">"Our mission is to bring rustic naturally leavened loaves to your dining table each and everyday. 
        Baking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat, typically in an oven, but can also be done in hot ashes, 
        or on hot stones. The most common baked item is bread but many other types of foods are baked.Heat is gradually transferred "from the surface of 
        cakes, cookies, and breads to their center.But we add more than than ingredients into our baked goods. Our secret ingredient is love.It increases
        the taste tenfold.As heat travels through, it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods and more with a firm dry crust and a softer center"</p>
